# Welcome to Neural Prism v5.1.0: The Spectrum Pulse

**By Lead Architect** | *Posted in Hub Updates*

The era of static AI interaction is over. Neural Prism v5.1.0 transforms raw intelligence into a spectrum of human utility.

## What's New in v5.1.0?

### 1. 🌈 The Rainbow Tool Suite
We've expanded to over 20 specialized tools. Whether you are designing a verified banking check, generating high-fidelity app icons, or practicing for a software interview, there is a specialized "prism refraction" for your task.

### 2. 🛡️ Sovereign Data Model
Your privacy is our priority. In this release, we've deepened the integration with your personal **Google Drive**. Neural Prism acts as a temporary lens—your data, code, and recordings reside exclusively in your personal cloud.

### 3. 🧠 Resilient Neural Links
The Interactive Studio now supports long-running human activities. Our new **Neural Rotation** protocol silently refreshes the AI connection every 5 minutes, maintaining conversational context for hours of continuous collaboration.

### 4. 📂 Heuristic Builder Studio
Our Code Studio now uses 100% **Neural Simulation** for code execution. Run C++, Python, or Rust instantly without the latency of virtual machines, featuring Socratic feedback that helps you learn as you build.

## Our Vision
We don't build tools for AI; we build a Prism for Humanity. We believe AI should be a colorful extension of the human mind, not a complex barrier.
