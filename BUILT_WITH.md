# 🛠️ Built With: The Neural Prism Technical Manifest

The Neural Prism is engineered as a high-performance, user-sovereign "Intelligence Hub." Below is the spectrum of technologies that power the refraction.

---

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture
*   **React 19**: The foundation for our refractive, component-based user interface.
*   **TypeScript**: Ensuring type-safe neural handshakes and robust data models.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Powering the high-fidelity, responsive "Night Mode" aesthetic.
*   **Lucide React**: Our library for lightweight, expressive iconography.
*   **Monaco Editor**: Powering the **Builder Studio** with a professional IDE experience.
*   **Plotly.js & Math.js**: Driving the **Graph Studio** for WebGL-accelerated math visualization.
*   **html2canvas & jsPDF**: Enabling high-resolution "Paperwork" generation (Checks, Labels, Books).

## 🧠 AI Intelligence Layer (Google Gemini)
The platform utilizes the **Gemini 3.0** ecosystem via the `@google/genai` SDK:
*   **Gemini 3 Pro**: Advanced reasoning, architectural design, and socratic mentorship.
*   **Gemini 3 Flash**: High-speed **Neural Simulation** and real-time logic tracing.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio**: Powering low-latency, multimodal WebSocket conversations in the **Interactive Studio**.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**: Generating high-fidelity art for the **Gift Workshop** and **Brand Lab**.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS**: Transforming text into emotive neural speech (Voices: Puck, Fenrir, Kore, Zephyr).

## ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure (Sovereign Model)
We utilize a hybrid cloud approach to ensure performance while maintaining user data ownership:
*   **Firebase (Google Cloud)**:
    *   **Auth**: Secure entry via Google OAuth 2.0.
    *   **Firestore**: The "Control Plane" for community hubs and the global VoiceCoin ledger.
    *   **Storage**: Hosting public assets and cryptographically signed certificates.
*   **Google Drive API**: Our primary persistence layer. All user-created code, documents, and recordings save directly to the user's private cloud.
*   **YouTube Data API**: Seamlessly posting neural recordings to the user's personal channel.
*   **Gmail API**: Automated notification dispatch for mentorship bookings.
*   **GitHub API**: Real-time repository synchronization in the **Builder Studio**.

## 🛡️ The Edge Data Plane (Privacy First)
*   **IndexedDB (Neural Cache)**: A client-side database that stores heavy neural audio fragments and VFS state for zero-latency interactions and offline resilience.
*   **Web Crypto API**: On-device generation of **ECDSA P-256** keys for the VoiceCoin Ledger. Private keys never leave your machine.
*   **CompressionStream API**: Native "Deflate-Raw" compression for generating PlantUML system diagrams.

---

## 🧩 Utilities & Tooling
*   **JSZip**: Bundling complex generative assets into portable packages.
*   **KaTeX**: High-fidelity LaTeX mathematical typesetting.
*   **PrismJS**: Syntax highlighting for the refractive Markdown viewer.
*   **Open-Meteo API**: Real-time environmental grounding for the platform calendar.

*Built for Humanity. Refracted by Neural Prism.*
